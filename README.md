The goal is to create a python package one step at a time. I will do it around a simple function I use for determining the convergence rate of a numerical algorithm.

Commit 1. Create a simple program structure [structure].

    conv-rate-package
    |----/convrate
    |       calc.py
    |----/tests
    |       test_calc.py
    â””----README.md

I included empty files in each folder so they would show up in the intial commit. I chose the name test_calc.py for the test file because I plan to use pytest and I'm fairly sure that's the naming convention for test in that framework.
